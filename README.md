# MemeWar: Královec

A mod for Hearts of Iron 4, inspired by an internet meme that parodied the referendum on annexation to the Russian Federation by the Czechs and Poles annexing Kaliningrad.

## State of mod

Currently the event has to be called decision for Czechoslovakia.

By starting this event you have three choices:

- Königsberg will be annexed by Czechoslovakia
- Königsberg will become the state of Königsberg and will be a puppet of the CZE
- Same as the second option, but you will play as this state

There will always be a division of the German exclave between Czechs and Poles.
When Poland and Czechoslovakia will mutually obtain a non-aggression agreement. Plus the Czechoslovaks will get military access to Poland to get into their territory.

## Goals

- At least a small focus tree referring to memes (for the Královec)
- The dream would be to bring it into the modern era as a submod of one of the modern mods, to make the whole thing fit better.
    - Novum Vexillum
    - ~~Millennium Dawn: A Modern Day Mod~~ (another submod is in progress)
